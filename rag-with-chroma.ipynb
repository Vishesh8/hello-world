So the class newsgroup \nwill not be monitored by the TAs and me. But this is a place for you to form study groups \nor find project partners or discuss homework problems and so on, and it's not monitored \nby the TAs and me. So feel free to ta lk trash about this class there.  \nIf you want to contact the teaching staff, pl ease use the email address written down here, \ncs229-qa@cs.stanford.edu. This goes to an acc ount that's read by all the TAs and me. So\n\nof this class will not be very program ming intensive, although we will do some \nprogramming, mostly in either MATLAB or Octa ve. I'll say a bit more about that later.  \nI also assume familiarity with basic proba bility and statistics. So most undergraduate \nstatistics class, like Stat 116 taught here at Stanford, will be more than enough. I'm gonna \nassume all of you know what ra ndom variables are, that all of you know what expectation \nis, what a variance or a random variable is. And in case of some of you, it's been a while \nsince you've seen some of this material. At some of the discussion sections, we'll actually \ngo over some of the prerequisites, sort of as  a refresher course under prerequisite class. \nI'll say a bit more about that later as well.  \nLastly, I also assume familiarity with basi c linear algebra. And again, most undergraduate \nlinear algebra courses are more than enough. So if you've taken courses like Math 51, \n103, Math 113 or CS205 at Stanford, that would be more than enough. Basically, I'm \ngonna assume that all of you know what matrix es and vectors are, that you know how to \nmultiply matrices and vectors and multiply matrix and matrices, that you know what a matrix inverse is. If you know what an eigenvect or of a matrix is, that'd be even better. \nBut if you don't quite know or if you're not qu ite sure, that's fine, too. We'll go over it in \nthe review sections.\n\nmany biologers are there here? Wow, just a few, not many. I'm surprised. Anyone from \nstatistics? Okay, a few. So where are the rest of you from?  \nStudent : iCME.  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Say again?  \nStudent : iCME.  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : iCME. Cool.  \nStudent : [Inaudible].  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Civi and what else?  \nStudent : [Inaudible]  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Synthesis, [inaudible] systems. Yeah, cool.  \nStudent : Chemi.  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Chemi. Cool.  \nStudent : [Inaudible].  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Aero/astro. Yes, right. Yeah, okay, cool. Anyone else?  \nStudent : [Inaudible].  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Pardon? MSNE. All ri ght. Cool. Yeah.  \nStudent : [Inaudible].  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Pardon?  \nStudent : [Inaudible].  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Endo —  \nStudent : [Inaudible].  \nInstructor (Andrew Ng) : Oh, I see, industry. Okay. Cool. Great, great. So as you can \ntell from a cross-section of th is class, I think we're a very diverse audience in this room, \nand that's one of the things that makes this class fun to teach and fun to be in, I think.\nHuman: What are major topics for this class?\u001B[0m\n\n\u001B[1m> Finished chain.\u001B[0m\n\n\u001B[1m> Finished chain.\u001B[0m\n"
